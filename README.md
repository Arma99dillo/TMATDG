# TMATDG
MATLAB package for the solution of multiple scattering problems, coupling Trefftz Discontinuos Galerkin methods for Helmholtz scattering with the T-matrix method

# Reproducibility Instructions
All the codes have been tested on MATLAB R2024b release. The MATLAB Partial Differential Equation Toolbox™ is needed for the correct working of the code. The `TMATROM_OBJECT_ORIENTED_CORE` directory is taken from the TMATROM package from https://github.com/stuart-hawkins/tmatrom with little modifications.
